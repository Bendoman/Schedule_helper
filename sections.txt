Song 127 and Prayer





King David organized the Levites and the priests for temple duty (1Ch 23:6, 27, 28; 24:1, 3; it-2 241, 686)
Expert musicians and learners were assigned to musical service (1Ch 25:1, 8; it-2 451-452)
Levites were assigned as gatekeepers, treasurers, and other officials (1Ch 26:16-20; it-1 898)





Worship that is organized reflects Jehovah’s personality. —1Co 14:33.
FOR MEDITATION: How is the Christian congregation well-organized for worship today?



Natural disasters are becoming more and more common today. When a disaster strikes, efforts to provide relief need to be well-organized and coordinated efficiently. To that end, the Governing Body has arranged for a Disaster Relief Department to be set up in every branch office.
When the brothers in that department learn of a disaster, they immediately contact the local elders to find out what help the publishers will need. If the damage is more extensive than the local publishers can handle themselves, the branch will assign qualified brothers to take the lead in the relief work. Those brothers may ask for volunteers or for donations of specific items, or they may purchase and distribute needed supplies locally.
There are many advantages to handling matters this way. It avoids duplication of effort, confusion, and waste of funds and materials, which can result when brothers act on their own initiative.
The brothers appointed by the branch can determine how much money and how many volunteers will be needed in the relief effort. They can also get acquainted with the local officials, who can often help us to expedite our relief efforts. So individuals should not take the initiative to collect funds, send relief supplies, or travel to the affected area unless they are asked to do so.
Still, when disaster strikes, we want to help. (Heb 13:16) We love our brothers! What can we do? Most important, we can pray for the victims of the disaster and for those providing relief. We can also donate funds through the worldwide work. Under the direction of the Governing Body, branch offices are in the best position to determine where these funds will do the most good. And if we wish to get involved personally, we can indicate that we are available by filling out the Local Design/ Construction Volunteer Application (DC-50).

Jehovah chose the temple for himself (2Ch 7:11, 12)
Jehovah’s heart would always be there, indicating that he would be highly interested in what went on at this house associated with his name (2Ch 7:16; w02 11/15 5 ¶1)
If the people stopped walking before Jehovah “with all their heart,” he would allow the temple to be destroyed (2Ch 6:14; 7:19-21; it-2 1077-1078)





At the time of the temple’s inauguration, the people likely thought their heart would always be at the temple. Sadly, the people gradually lost their enthusiasm for worshipping Jehovah.

We have four Bible study videos for use in the ministry. For what purpose was each one designed?





Why Study the Bible? —Full Length was designed to stimulate interest in the Bible regardless of a person’s religious beliefs. It encourages viewers to look into the Bible for answers to life’s big questions and gives a sample of the logical information found there. It explains how to request a Bible study.






Why Study the Bible? (shortened version) is similar to the full-length version but is about a third of the length. It may be more effective in territories where people are in a hurry.






What Happens at a Bible Study? was designed to stimulate interest in our free Bible study program and to answer some common questions about it, including how to request a study.






Welcome to Your Bible Study was designed to be shown to Bible students. Although the video is introduced on page two of the Enjoy Life Forever! book, it may be shown when discussing the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. The video outlines the contents of the book and what the student can expect during discussions.


Although each video was designed for a particular purpose, any of them may be shown or sent to people when appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to become well-acquainted with and make good use of them in the ministry.
