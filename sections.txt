Adam was a real person (1Ch 1:1; w09 9/1 14 ¶1)
Noah was also a real person (1Ch 1:4; w08 6/1 3 ¶4)





When we understand that people in the Bible are, not mythical characters, but real people, we better appreciate the lessons we learn from their example. —1Co 15:22; w09 9/1 14-15.



God’s Word can transform our lives. (Heb 4:12) However, to benefit from its guidance, direction, and counsel, we need to be convinced that it is indeed “the word of God.” (1Th 2:13) How can we strengthen our faith in the Bible?
Read a portion of the Bible each day. As you read, look for evidence that Jehovah is its Author. For example, examine the advice contained in the book of Proverbs and take note of its timeless wisdom. —Pr 13:20; 14:30.
Start a study project. Become familiar with evidence that proves that the Bible is inspired. In the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses, look under the subject “The Bible” and then “Inspired by God.” You can also strengthen your faith that the Bible’s message has not changed by examining the information contained in Appendix A3 of the New World Translation.

Jabez was an honorable man (1Ch 4:9)
His prayer revealed his concern for true worship (1Ch 4:10a; w10 10/1 23 ¶3-7)
Jehovah answered Jabez’ prayer (1Ch 4:10b)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘What do my prayers reveal about me?’ —Mt 6:9, 10.



Why prepare? Medical emergencies and hospitalization can occur suddenly and without warning. Therefore, before an emergency arises, take full advantage of the provisions available to help you receive the best medical care possible. By doing so, you show respect for life and Jehovah’s law on blood. —Ac 15:28, 29.
What can you do to prepare?
  Carefully and prayerfully fill out a durable power of attorney (DPA) card.* Baptized publishers can obtain from the literature servant a DPA card for themselves as well as an Identity Card (ic) for their minor children

  If you are pregnant, ask your elders for a copy of Information for Expectant Mothers (S-401). This document will help you make good decisions about medical issues that may arise during pregnancy and childbirth

  If you require a medical procedure that may involve the blood issue or a hospital stay, let your elders know in advance and inform the hospital that you would welcome a visit from a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses


How can the elders assist? They can help you fill out your DPA card. However, elders will not make medical decisions for you or express their personal views on matters of individual choice. (Ro 14:12; Ga 6:5) When you inform your local elders that you are facing a medical situation that may involve blood, they will promptly contact the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) on your behalf.
How can the HLC help? Brothers serving on the HLC are trained to help those in the medical and legal communities understand our religious position regarding blood. They can discuss medical treatment strategies for avoiding blood transfusions with your health-care provider. If needed, they can help you to find a cooperative doctor.

The Levite gatekeepers occupied an office of great responsibility (1Ch 9:26, 27; w05 10/1 9 ¶8)
Phinehas was chief of the tabernacle gatekeepers in the days of Moses (1Ch 9:17-20a)
Jehovah helped Phinehas to fulfill his assignment (1Ch 9:20b; w11 9/15 32 ¶7)





Jehovah gives us plenty of important work. If you are ever unsure about how to carry out an assignment, pray to Jehovah and ask a mature Christian for help. —Php 2:13.



During these last days, we experience many difficult trials. At times, we may feel that our trials are too much for us to bear. However, if we continue to draw close to Jehovah, he will help us to endure even the most heartbreaking of trials. (Isa 43:2, 4) How can we draw close to Jehovah when we go through trials?
Prayer. When we pour our heart out to Jehovah, he gives us the peace and emotional strength to endure. —Php 4:6, 7; 1Th 5:17.
Meetings. More than ever, we need the spiritual food and association that Jehovah provides at our meetings. (Heb 10:24, 25) When we prepare for, attend, and participate in congregation meetings, we take full advantage of the help of Jehovah’s spirit. —Re 2:29.
Ministry. We will find it easier to focus on positive things if we do everything we can to remain active in the ministry. We will also strengthen our bonds of friendship with Jehovah and our fellow workers. —1Co 3:5-10.

Because Saul was disobedient, Jehovah rejected him (1Ch 10:13, 14)

Unlike Saul, David let himself be guided by Jehovah’s laws and principles (1Ch 11:15-19; w12 11/15 6 ¶12-13)
David loved doing God’s will. (Ps 40:8) We can cultivate a similar desire to do what is right by learning to view things the way Jehovah does. —Ps 25:4; w18.06 17 ¶5-6.



We want to please Jehovah in all that we do. (Pr 27:11) To do so, we need to make decisions that reflect his thinking even when there is no clear-cut law or command to guide us. What can help us to do that?
Maintain a regular routine of Bible study. Each time we read the Bible, it is as if we were spending time with Jehovah. We can learn about Jehovah’s way of thinking by observing how he dealt with his people and by examining the examples of those who did good or bad in his eyes. When we need to make a decision, holy spirit can recall to our mind important lessons and principles that we have learned from God’s Word. —Joh 14:26.
Do research. When you face a decision, ask yourself, ‘What verses or accounts in the Bible can help me to understand how Jehovah feels about the matter?’ Pray for Jehovah’s help, and use the theocratic research tools available in your language to help you to find and apply Bible principles that are relevant to your situation. —Ps 25:4.
