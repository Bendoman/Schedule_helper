King Saul felt that he was in a desperate situation (1Sa 13:5-7)
Rather than modestly following Jehovah’s instructions, Saul acted presumptuously (1Sa 13:8, 9; w00 8/1 13 ¶17)
Jehovah disciplined Saul (1Sa 13:13, 14; w07 6/15 27 ¶8)
Someone acts presumptuously when he rashly or foolishly does something that he is not authorized to do. Presumptuousness is contrasted with modesty. What situations could tempt someone to be presumptuous?

Song 13 and Prayer





David’s faith in Jehovah was based on knowledge and experience (1Sa 17:36, 37; wp16.5 11 ¶2-3)
David looked at Goliath in comparison to Jehovah, not himself (1Sa 17:45-47; wp16.5 11-12)
Jehovah gave David the victory over an imposing enemy (1Sa 17:48-50; wp16.5 12 ¶4; see cover picture)





At times, we may face huge challenges, such as persecution or a bad habit. When problems seem too big, remember that they are small in comparison to Jehovah’s limitless power. —Job 42:1, 2.



David defeated Goliath because he relied on Jehovah. (1Sa 17:45) Jehovah wants to show his strength in behalf of all his servants. (2Ch 16:9) How can we rely on the help that Jehovah provides rather than on our own experience and abilities? Here are three ways:
 Pray often. Pray not just for forgiveness after making a mistake but also for strength when facing a temptation. (Mt 6:12, 13) Pray not just for Jehovah’s blessing on decisions that have already been made but also for his direction and wisdom before making decisions. —Jas 1:5

 Have a routine of Bible reading and study. Read the Bible every day. (Ps 1:2) Ponder over Bible examples, and apply the lessons learned. (Jas 1:23-25) Prepare for the ministry instead of relying on personal experience. Benefit fully from congregation meetings by considering the material in advance

 Cooperate with Jehovah’s organization. Keep up-to-date with direction from the organization, and then follow through promptly. (Nu 9:17) Listen to the elders when they give counsel and instructions. —Heb 13:17

Jehovah gave David success in all he did (1Sa 18:14)
David remained humble (1Sa 18:22, 23; w18.01 28 ¶6-7)





Why is it important for us to remain humble when we receive blessings from Jehovah? What will help us to remain humble?



Only those who are morally clean can enjoy a close relationship with Jehovah. (1Pe 1:14-16) As Bible students conquer bad habits, they may also experience family, health, and financial benefits.
Clearly explain Jehovah’s moral standards, the reasons for them, and the benefits of following them. Focus on helping your students to change their pattern of thinking, and their actions will follow. (Eph 4:22-24) Assure them that with Jehovah’s help they can overcome an ingrained bad habit. (Php 4:13) Teach them to supplicate Jehovah when they experience the urge to sin. Help them to recognize tempting situations that they should avoid. Encourage them to replace unclean habits with wholesome activities. Joy results from seeing Bible students succeed in making changes with Jehovah’s help.

Comfort and encourage your friend when he is distressed (1Sa 20:1, 2; w19.11 7 ¶18)
Warn your friend when there is danger (1Sa 20:12, 13; w08 2/15 8 ¶7)
Defend your friend when he is slandered (1Sa 20:30-32; w09 10/15 19 ¶11)





Jehovah’s people have many opportunities to develop good friendships. To have a friend, we must be a friend. Whom would you like to befriend in the congregation?



A friend is defined as “one attached to another by affection or esteem.” For example, Jonathan and David began an unbreakable friendship after David killed Goliath. (1Sa 18:1) Each man displayed qualities that endeared him to the other. Therefore, strong friendships are based on accurate knowledge. Getting to know another person generally takes time and effort. However, on social networks, people can become “friends” with just the click of a mouse. Because people online are able to plan exactly what to say and control to some extent how others view them, it is easy for them to hide who they really are. Therefore, it is good to have an online ‘friending policy.’ Do not be afraid to ignore or reject friend requests from people you do not really know for fear of hurting their feelings. In view of the potential dangers, some have chosen not to use social networks at all. However, if you choose to use a social network, what should you keep in mind?
WATCH THE VIDEO BE SOCIAL-NETWORK SMART, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:





  What should you consider before posting comments and pictures?






  Why should you choose your online friends carefully?






  Why should you set limits on the amount of time you spend on a social network? —Eph 5:15, 16

David had an opportunity to end his trial (1Sa 24:3-5)
David viewed his situation from Jehovah’s standpoint and exercised restraint (1Sa 24:6, 7)
David had faith that Jehovah would resolve matters (1Sa 24:12, 15; w04 4/1 16 ¶8)
Like David, we should wait patiently on Jehovah instead of using unscriptural means to end trials. —Jas 1:4; w04 6/1 22-23.



Trials can easily discourage us, especially when they are prolonged. David knew that his trial involving King Saul would eventually end and that he would become king, as Jehovah had promised. (1Sa 16:13) David’s faith helped him to be patient and wait on Jehovah.
When under trial, we may be able to use shrewdness, knowledge, or thinking ability to change our situation. (1Sa 21:12-14; Pr 1:4) However, some difficulties will persist even after we have done all we can in harmony with Bible principles. In such cases, we must exercise patience and wait on Jehovah. Soon he will end all our suffering and “wipe out every tear” from our eyes. (Re 21:4) Whether our relief comes as a result of Jehovah’s intervention or because of other reasons, one thing is certain: All trials have an expiration date. This fact can give us a measure of comfort.

Abigail helped David to avoid bloodguilt (1Sa 25:25, 26, 32, 33; ia 80 ¶18)
ASK YOURSELF: ‘Do I tend to act on impulse when I am angry, when I am shopping, or when I am discouraged? Or do I pause to consider the consequences before I act?’ —Pr 15:28; 22:3.



Jehovah wants us to serve him out of love. (Mt 22:37, 38) It is love for God that will empower Bible students to make needed changes and stand firm under trial. (1Jo 5:3) It is their love for God that will motivate them to get baptized.
Help your students to see God’s love for them. Ask such questions as: “What does this teach you about Jehovah?” or “How does this show God’s love for you?” Help them to perceive how Jehovah is helping them personally. (2Ch 16:9) Share examples of how Jehovah has answered your specific prayers, and encourage them to notice how Jehovah answers theirs. Great joy results from seeing Bible students respond to Jehovah’s love and demonstrate their strong attachment to him.
