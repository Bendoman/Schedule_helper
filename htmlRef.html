                    Natural disasters are becoming more and more common today. When a disaster strikes, efforts to
                    provide relief need to be well-organized and coordinated efficiently. To that end, the Governing
                    Body has arranged for a Disaster Relief Department to be set up in every branch office.
                </p>
                <p class="p4" data-pid="4" id="p4">
                    When the brothers in that department learn of a disaster, they immediately contact the local elders
                    to find out what help the publishers will need. If the damage is more extensive than the local
                    publishers can handle themselves, the branch will assign qualified brothers to take the lead in the
                    relief work. Those brothers may ask for volunteers or for donations of specific items, or they may
                    purchase and distribute needed supplies locally.
                </p>
                <p class="p5" data-pid="5" id="p5">
                    There are many advantages to handling matters this way. It avoids duplication of effort, confusion,
                    and waste of funds and materials, which can result when brothers act on their own initiative.
                </p>
                <p class="p6" data-pid="6" id="p6">
                    The brothers appointed by the branch can determine how much money and how many volunteers will be
                    needed in the relief effort. They can also get acquainted with the local officials, who can often
                    help us to expedite our relief efforts. So individuals should not take the initiative to collect
                    funds, send relief supplies, or travel to the affected area unless they are asked to do so.
                </p>
                <p class="p7" data-pid="7" id="p7">
                    Still, when disaster strikes, we want to help. (

                    and for those providing relief. We can also donate funds through the worldwide work. Under the
                    direction of the Governing Body, branch offices are in the best position to determine where these
                    funds will do the most good. And if we wish to get involved personally, we can indicate that we are

                        Now the queen of Sheʹba heard the report about Solʹo·mon, so she came to Jerusalem to test
                        Solʹo·mon with perplexing questions.* She was accompanied by a very impressive entourage,* with
                        camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones. She went in to
                        Solʹo·mon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart.

                        ) The Israelites considered singing to be an important part of their worship. King David
                        assigned 288 Levites to be singers at the temple. (

                        ) Today, we can express our love for God when we sing songs of praise. The quality of our voice
                        is not the most important thing. Consider this comparison: When we speak, “we all stumble many
                        times,” but that does not prevent us from speaking in the congregation and in the ministry. (
                        <span id="citationsource11">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) Similarly, we should not allow concerns about the imperfections of our singing voice to
                        prevent us from singing praises to Jehovah.

                    impossible without an international organization. To illustrate, you can easily feed one person on
                    your own, but if you have to feed many thousands, even millions, you will need a well-organized
                    group of people whose efforts are coordinated. In fulfilling their commission, true Christians serve

                    experienced climbers. However, if he has an accident or gets into difficulty, he will be in serious

                            What does it mean to abstain from blood? If a doctor told you to abstain from alcohol, you
                            would not drink it. But would you eat foods that contained it or have alcohol injected into
                            your veins? Obviously not. Likewise, God’s command to abstain from blood means that we
                            should not drink blood or eat meat that has not been bled. Nor should we eat any food to
                            which blood has been added.

                            What about the medical use of blood? Some procedures clearly violate God’s law. These
                            include the transfusion of whole blood or any of its main components​—red cells, white
                            cells, platelets, and plasma. Other medical procedures may not be a clear-cut violation of
                            God’s law. For example, some procedures involve the use of fractions of one of the main
                            components of blood. Other procedures involve the use of a person’s own blood. When weighing
                            these options, each of us must make a personal decision.

                            When it comes to blood fractions, each Christian must make his own decision based on his
                            Bible-trained conscience. Some may decide to refuse a medical treatment or procedure that
                            involves blood fractions. Others may feel that their conscience allows them to accept
                            fractions.

                            Some doctors view the four main components of blood as fractions. Therefore, you may need to
                            explain your personal decision not to accept transfusions of whole blood or of red cells,
                            white cells, platelets, or plasma.

                            There are medical procedures that make use of a patient’s own blood. Some of these​—such as
                            a person donating blood or having his own blood stored in advance of surgery—​are not
                            acceptable for Christians.​—

                            However, other procedures may not be objectionable. These include blood tests, hemodialysis,
                            hemodilution, or the use of a cell-salvage or heart-lung bypass machine. Each Christian must
                            decide for himself how his own blood will be handled
                            <em>
                                in the course of a procedure, medical test, or current therapy.
                            </em>
                            Each doctor may perform these procedures slightly differently. So before accepting any
                            surgical procedure, medical test, or therapy, a Christian needs to find out exactly how his
                            own blood will be handled. Consider the following questions:

                                    What if some of my blood would be diverted outside my body and the flow might be
                                    interrupted for a time? Does my conscience allow me to view this blood as still part
                                    of me, thus not requiring that it be poured “out on the ground”?​—

                    judges, gatekeepers, and treasurers, as well as a vast number to assist the priests in the temple,
                    the courtyards, and the dining rooms in connection with the offerings, sacrifices, purification
                    work, weighing, measuring, and various guard duties. Levite musicians were organized into 24 groups,
                    similar to the priestly divisions, and served in rotation. Duties were determined by casting lots.
                    In the case of the groups of gatekeepers, the particular gate assignment was chosen in the same
                    way.​—

                    musicians. Each son was appointed by lot to be the head of one division of musicians. Under his
                    direction were 11 more “experts,” selected from his own sons as well as other Levites. In this
                    manner the 288 ([1 + 11] × 24 = 288) expert Levite musicians, like the priests, were separated into
                    24 courses. If all the remaining 3,712 ‘learners’ were thus divided, it would average about 155 more
                    men to each of the 24 divisions, meaning there were about 13 Levites in various stages of musical
                    education and training to each expert. (

                    Shortly before his death, King David thoroughly organized the Levites and temple workers, including
                    the gatekeepers, of whom there were 4,000. In their divisions they would come in for seven days at a
                    time. They were responsible to guard Jehovah’s house and see that the doors were opened and closed
                    at the proper times. (

                    ) Besides guard duty, some took care of the contributions brought in by the people for use at the
                    temple. (

                    assigned to the gates of the temple to protect young Jehoash from the usurper, Queen Athaliah. (

                    ) When King Josiah destroyed idolatrous worship, the doorkeepers assisted in removing from the
                    temple the utensils that had been used in the worship of Baal. These were then burned up outside the
                    city.​—

                                        It could be easy to think, ‘I failed, so I may as well give up.’ But think about
                                        this: Just because a runner stumbles and falls, it does not mean that he has
                                        lost the race, nor does he have to start the race over again. Similarly, a
                                        relapse does not mean that you have lost the fight against overcoming the bad
                                        habit. Nor does it erase all the progress you have already made. Relapses are
                                        normal​—they are part of the road to recovery. Don’t give up! With Jehovah’s
                                        help, you can conquer the bad habit.

                    Our sense of identity as servants of Jehovah can weaken if it is not solidly based on knowledge of
                    the Scriptures. (
                    <span id="citationsource4">

                    <a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation4">

                    </a>
                    ) Every Christian​—young or old—​needs to prove to his own satisfaction that what he believes is
                    indeed the truth as found in the Bible. Paul urged fellow believers: “Make sure of all things; hold
                    fast to what is fine.” (
                    <span id="citationsource5">

                    </a>
                    ) Young Christians who belong to God-fearing families must realize that they cannot live off the
                    faith of their parents. Solomon’s own father, David, exhorted him to
                    <em>
                        “know
                    </em>
                    the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart.” (
                    <span id="citationsource6">

                    </a>
                    ) It would not be enough for young Solomon to watch how his own father built faith in Jehovah. He
                    had to get to know Jehovah for himself, and he did. He beseeched God: “Give me now wisdom and
                    knowledge that I may go out before this people and that I may come in.”​—

                    The lesson is obvious. It is commendable if we share regularly in such wholesome and satisfying
                    activities as attending congregation meetings and participating in field service. But serving
                    Jehovah with a complete heart involves more. (

                    ) If deep down in his heart a Christian continues to love “the things behind”​—that is, certain
                    aspects of the world’s way of life—​he is in danger of losing his good standing with God. (

                    </a>
                    ) Only if we truly “abhor what is wicked [and] cling to what is good” will we be “well fitted for
                    the kingdom of God.” (

                                what he sees. Ask additional questions, as needed, to emphasize key ideas. When playing
                                a video, turn the screen to face your listener. Generally, it is not necessary to talk

                            Many people feel uncomfortable talking about sex. However, when the Bible mentions sex, it
                            does so in a frank but dignified way. What it says benefits us. That makes sense. After all,
                            Jehovah is our Creator. So he knows what is best for us. He shows us how our actions can
                            please him and what will help us to enjoy life forever.

                            Sex is a gift from Jehovah. He wants it to be enjoyed by a man and a woman who are married
                            to each other. This gift allows couples not only to have children but also to express their
                            mutual love and affection in a natural and pleasurable way. That is why God’s Word states:

                    because they are numerous, and in steeds, because they are very mighty, but who have not looked to
                    the Holy One of Israel and have not searched for Jehovah himself.”​—

                    In Israel no sizable national chariot force developed until the time of Solomon. This was due in
                    large measure to God’s warning that the king was not to multiply horses, as if the nation’s security
                    depended on them. This restriction limited the use of chariots, since horses were used to power such
                    vehicles. (

                        to them ‘so that they can seize him.’ (

                        The next day, Sunday, Nisan 9, Jesus leaves Bethany with his disciples and heads to Jerusalem.
                        As they approach Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus tells two of his disciples:

                        “Go into the village that is within sight, and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt
                        with her. Untie them and bring them to me. If someone says anything to you, you must say, ‘The
                        Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them.”​—

                        into Jerusalem “humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a female donkey.”​—

                        Jesus. The disciples place their outer garments on the donkey and on its offspring, but Jesus
                        mounts the colt.

                        Others cut branches from the trees or “foliage from the fields” and spread them out. They cry:
                        “Save, we pray! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s name! Blessed is the coming Kingdom of
                        our father David!” (

                        will pay the price for willful disobedience. Jesus foretells: “Your enemies will build around

                        They will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone

                        Jesus and his disciples have spent three nights in Bethany since they arrived from Jericho. Now,
                        early in the morning on Monday, Nisan 10, they are heading to Jerusalem. Jesus is hungry. So
                        when he sees a fig tree, he walks toward it. Does it have figs?

                        It is now late March, but the season for figs is not until June. Still, the leaves are out,
                        having sprouted early. Thus, Jesus feels that there might be early figs. He finds, though, that
                        there are none. The leaves have given the tree a deceptive appearance. Jesus then says: “Let no
                        one eat fruit from you ever again.” (
                        <span id="citationsource73">

                        </a>
                        ) Immediately the tree starts to wither, the meaning of which is to be learned the next morning.

                        Before long, Jesus and his disciples reach Jerusalem. He goes to the temple, which he inspected
                        the previous afternoon. Today he does more than make an inspection; he takes action similar to
                        what he did three years earlier at the Passover of 30 C.E. (
                        <span id="citationsource74">

                        </a>
                        ) This time Jesus throws out “those selling and buying in the temple.” He also overturns “the
                        tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.” (
                        <span id="citationsource75">

                        </a>
                        ) He does not even let anyone carrying things to another part of the city take a shortcut
                        through the temple courtyard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p9">
                        Why is Jesus taking decisive action against those changing money and selling animals in the
                        temple? He says: “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the
                        nations’? But you have made it a cave of robbers.” (
                        <span id="citationsource76">

                        </a>
                        ) His reason for calling these men robbers is that they demand exorbitant prices from those who
                        have to buy animals needed for sacrifice. Jesus views their dealings as extortion, or robbery.

                        Of course, the chief priests, scribes, and principal ones of the people hear what Jesus has
                        done, and they respond with renewed efforts to have him killed. However, they face a problem.
                        They do not know how to do away with Jesus, because the people are flocking to hear him.

                        Not only natural Jews but also proselytes, converts to the Jews’ religion, have come for the
                        Passover. Among them are Greeks who have come to worship at the festival. These approach Philip,
                        perhaps attracted by his Greek name, and ask to see Jesus. Philip may be unsure whether such a
                        meeting is appropriate, so he confers with Andrew. The two take the matter to Jesus, who is
                        apparently still at the temple.

                        Jesus knows that he is to die in a few days, so this is not the time to satisfy people’s
                        curiosity or to seek popularity. He responds to the two apostles with an illustration, saying:
                        “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. Most truly I say to you, unless a grain
                        of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just one grain; but if it dies, it then bears
                        much fruit.”​—

                        One grain of wheat might seem of little value. Yet, if it is put into the soil and “dies” as a
                        seed, it can germinate and in time grow into a productive stalk with many grains. Similarly,
                        Jesus is one perfect man. Still, by his being faithful to God till his death, he will become the
                        means of imparting everlasting life to many who have a similar spirit of self-sacrifice. Thus,
                        Jesus says: “Whoever is fond of his life destroys it, but whoever hates his life in this world
                        will safeguard it for everlasting life.”​—

                        avoid accomplishing God’s will. He adds: “Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour.” (

                        At the temple on Monday, Nisan 10, Jesus is speaking about his approaching death. Concerned
                        about how God’s reputation will be affected, Jesus says: “Father, glorify your name.” A mighty
                        voice from the heavens responds: “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”​—

                        Three and a half years earlier, at Jesus’ baptism, John the Baptist heard God say of Jesus:
                        “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.” Later, after the Passover of 32 C.E., Jesus
                        was transfigured before James, John, and Peter. Those three men heard God declare: “This is my
                        Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. Listen to him.” (

                    <p class="p9">
                        Jesus says: “This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for your sakes.” (

                        Moreover, Jesus’ faithful life course both exemplifies the way humans should live and confirms
                        that Satan the Devil, the ruler of the world, deserves to be executed. Jesus says: “Now there is
                        a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” Rather than being a
                        defeat, Jesus’ approaching death will be a victory. How so? He explains: “Yet I, if I am lifted
                        up from the earth, will draw all sorts of men to myself.” (

                        this Son of man?” (

                        have the light, so that darkness does not overpower you . . . While you have the light, exercise

                        Looking back on Jesus’ ministry, it is clear that prophecy was being fulfilled when the Jews did
                        not put faith in him. Isaiah foretold that the eyes of people would be blinded and their hearts
                        would be hard so that they would not turn around to be healed. (

                        Leaving Jerusalem on Monday afternoon, Jesus returns to Bethany on the eastern slope of the
                        Mount of Olives. He likely spends the night at the home of his friends Lazarus, Mary, and
                        Martha.

                    <p class="p7">
                        Now it is the morning of Nisan 11. Jesus and his disciples are on the road again, heading back
                        to Jerusalem where he will be at the temple for the last time. And it is the final day of his
                        public ministry before he celebrates the Passover, institutes the Memorial of his death, and
                        then faces trial and execution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        En route from Bethany over the Mount of Olives toward Jerusalem, Peter notices the tree that
                        Jesus cursed the previous morning. “Rabbi, see!” he exclaims, “the fig tree that you cursed has
                        withered.”​—

                    <p class="p9">
                        But why did Jesus cause the tree to wither? He reveals the reason in his response: “Truly I say
                        to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree, but
                        even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. And
                        all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.” (
                        <span id="citationsource104">

                        </a>
                        ) He is thus repeating the point he made earlier about faith being able to move a mountain.​—
                        <span id="citationsource105">

                    </p>
                    <p class="p10">
                        So by causing the tree to wither, Jesus provides an object lesson on the need to have faith in
                        God. He states: “All the things you pray and ask for, have faith that you have received them,
                        and you will have them.” (
                        <span id="citationsource106">

                        </a>
                        ) What an important lesson for all of Jesus’ followers! It is especially appropriate for the
                        apostles in view of the difficult tests they will soon face. There is yet another connection
                        between the withering of the fig tree and the quality of faith.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p11">
                        Like this fig tree, the nation of Israel has a deceptive appearance. The people of this nation
                        are in a covenant relationship with God, and they might outwardly appear to observe his Law.
                        However, the nation as a whole has proved to be both lacking faith and barren of good fruitage.
                        They even reject God’s own Son! Hence, by causing the unproductive fig tree to wither, Jesus
                        demonstrates what the end will be for this fruitless, faithless nation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p12">
                        Shortly, Jesus and his disciples enter Jerusalem. As is his custom, Jesus goes to the temple and
                        begins teaching. The chief priests and elders of the people, likely having in mind what Jesus
                        did the day before to the money changers, challenge him: “By what authority do you do these
                        things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”​—

                        do these things. Was the baptism by John from heaven or from men? Answer me.” Now his opponents
                        are the ones being challenged. The priests and elders consult one another about how to answer:
                        “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why, then, did you not believe him?’ But dare we say,
                        ‘From men’?” They reason this way because they are in fear of the crowd, “for these all held
                        that John had really been a prophet.”​—

                        At the temple, Jesus has just confounded the chief priests and the elders of the people, who
                        challenged him as to the authority by which he is doing things. Jesus’ reply silences them. Then
                        he gives an illustration that exposes what kind of people they really are.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p7">
                        Jesus relates: “A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in
                        the vineyard.’ In answer this one said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward, he felt regret and went
                        out. Approaching the second, he said the same. This one replied, ‘I will, Sir,’ but did not go
                        out. Which of the two did the will of his father?” (
                        <span id="citationsource113">
                        </span>

                        ) The answer is obvious​—the first son is the one who in the end did his father’s will.

                        So Jesus tells his opposers: “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are
                        going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God.” The tax collectors and the prostitutes initially
                        would not serve God. However, like the first son, they later repented and now are serving him.
                        In contrast, the religious leaders are like the second son, professing to serve God but really
                        failing to do so. Jesus notes: “John [the Baptist] came to you in a way of righteousness, but
                        you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even
                        when you saw this, you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him.”​—

                        Jesus follows up that illustration with another. This time, Jesus shows that the religious
                        leaders’ failure goes beyond neglecting to serve God. They are actually wicked. “A man planted a
                        vineyard,” Jesus relates, “and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected
                        a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad. In due season he sent a slave to
                        the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them. But they took him, beat
                        him, and sent him away empty-handed. Again he sent another slave to them, and that one they
                        struck on the head and dishonored. And he sent another, and that one they killed, and many
                        others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed.”​—

                        Will those hearing Jesus understand the illustration? Well, they may remember Isaiah’s words of
                        criticism: “The vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel; the men of Judah are the
                        plantation he was fond of. He kept hoping for justice, but look! there was injustice.” (
                        <span id="citationsource116">
                        </span>

                            Isaiah 5:7
                        </a>
                        ) Jesus’ illustration is similar. The landowner is Jehovah, and the vineyard is the nation of
                        Israel, fenced in and protected by God’s Law. Jehovah sent prophets to instruct his people and
                        help them produce good fruitage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p11">
                        However, “the cultivators” mistreated and killed the “slaves” sent to them. Jesus explains: “One
                        more [the owner of the vineyard] had, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, ‘They
                        will respect my son.’ But those cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let
                        us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ So they took him and killed him.”​—

                    <p class="p12">
                        Now Jesus asks: “What will the owner of the vineyard do?” (

                        ) The religious leaders answer: “Because they are evil, he will bring a terrible destruction on
                        them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators, who will give him the fruits when they
                        become due.”​—

                        They thus unwittingly proclaim judgment upon themselves, for they are among “the cultivators” of
                        Jehovah’s “vineyard,” the nation of Israel. The fruitage that Jehovah rightly expects from such
                        cultivators includes faith in his Son, the Messiah. Jesus looks straight at the religious
                        leaders and says: “Did you never read this scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected,
                        this has become the chief cornerstone. This has come from Jehovah, and it is marvelous in our
                        eyes’?” (

                        ) Then Jesus drives home his point: “This is why I say to you, the Kingdom of God will be taken
                        from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.”​—

                        consider Jesus a prophet, so they do not try to kill him right then.

                        As Jesus’ ministry draws to an end, he continues to use illustrations to expose the scribes and
                        the chief priests. Hence, they want to kill him. (
                        <span id="citationsource124">

                        </a>
                        ) But Jesus is not finished exposing them. He relates another illustration:
                    </p>
                    <p class="p6">
                        “The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son. And
                        he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to
                        come.” (

                        </a>
                        ) Jesus introduces his illustration by mentioning “the Kingdom of the heavens.” Logically, then,
                        the “king” must be Jehovah God. What of the king’s son and those invited to the marriage feast?
                        Again, it is not difficult to identify the king’s son as Jehovah’s Son, who is there presenting
                        the illustration, and to grasp that those invited are the ones who will be with the Son in the
                        Kingdom of the heavens.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p7">
                        Who are the first ones to be invited? Well, to whom have Jesus and the apostles been preaching
                        about the Kingdom? It has been to the Jews. (

                        ) This nation accepted the Law covenant in 1513 B.C.E., thereby coming first in line to make up
                        “a kingdom of priests.” (

                        ) But when would they actually be called to “the marriage feast”? Logically, that invitation
                        went out in 29 C.E. when Jesus began preaching about the Kingdom of the heavens.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        And how did most Israelites respond to the invitation? As Jesus said, “they were unwilling to
                        come.” The majority of the religious leaders and the people did not accept him as the Messiah
                        and as God’s designated King.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p9">
                        Jesus indicates, though, that the Jews were to have another opportunity: “Again [the king] sent
                        other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and
                        fattened animals are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’ But
                        unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his business; but the rest, seizing
                        his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.” (
                        <span id="citationsource129">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) That corresponds to what would occur once the Christian congregation was established. At that
                        time, the Jews still had the opportunity to be in the Kingdom, yet most spurned this call, even
                        abusing ‘the king’s slaves.’​—

                        Does their refusing the king’s call mean that no one else would be invited? Not according to
                        Jesus’ illustration. He goes on to say: “Then [the king] said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast
                        is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Therefore, go to the roads leading out of the city,
                        and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast.’ Accordingly, those slaves went out to the
                        roads and gathered all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies
                        was filled with those dining.”​—

                        marriage garment. So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here without a marriage
                        garment?’ He was speechless. Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and
                        throw him into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth
                        will be.’ For there are many invited, but few chosen.”​—

                        were seven brothers with us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his

                        Last of all, the woman died. So in the resurrection, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For

                        rise from the dead, neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels

                        relatively small cases containing short passages from the Law. The Pharisees enlarge theirs to
                        give the impression that they are zealous about the Law. Also, they “lengthen the fringes of
                        their garments.” The Israelites were to make fringes on their garments, but the Pharisees make
                        sure that their fringes are quite long. (

                        and act? Jesus tells them: “The greatest one among you must be your minister. Whoever exalts
                        himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”​—

                        and Pharisees, openly calling them hypocrites. He uses illustrative language, saying: “You
                        cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of greediness and
                        self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that
                        the outside of it may also become clean.” (

                        appearance, they are neglecting the inner person and are failing to purify their figurative

                        just that, the rich “dropping in many coins” as gifts. Then Jesus observes a poor widow who

                        had to live on.” (

                        As Nisan 11 progresses, Jesus leaves the temple for the last time. One of his disciples
                        exclaims: “Teacher, see! what wonderful stones and buildings!” (
                        <span id="citationsource187">

                        ) Indeed, some of the stones in the temple’s walls are extremely large, contributing to the
                        impression of its strength and permanence. It certainly seems strange, then, that Jesus says:
                        “Do you see these great buildings? By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be
                        thrown down.”​—

                        After saying these things, Jesus and his apostles cross the Kidron Valley and climb to a spot on
                        the Mount of Olives. At one point he is with four of the apostles​—Peter, Andrew, James, and
                        John. From that position, they can gaze down on the magnificent temple.

                        It is Tuesday afternoon, and Nisan 11 is drawing to a close. Also ending are days of intense
                        activity here on earth for Jesus. By day he has been teaching in the temple, and by night he has
                        lodged outside the city. There has been great interest among the people, who “would come to him
                        early in the morning to hear him in the temple.” (
                        <span id="citationsource192">

                        </a>
                        ) Now that is past, and Jesus is seated on the Mount of Olives with four apostles​—Peter,
                        Andrew, James, and John.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        These four have come to him privately. They are concerned about the temple because Jesus has
                        just foretold that not a stone of it will be left upon a stone. They have more on their minds,
                        though. Jesus had earlier urged them: “Keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think
                        likely, the Son of man is coming.” (
                        <span id="citationsource193">

                        </a>
                        ) He had also spoken about the “day when the Son of man is revealed.” (
                        <span id="citationsource194">
                        </span>

                        ) Are those comments somehow related to what he just said about the temple? The apostles are
                        very curious. “Tell us,” they say, “when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your
                        presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”​—

                        They may have in mind the end of the very temple that they can see not far away. Also, they ask
                        about the presence of the Son of man. They may recall that Jesus gave an illustration about “a
                        man of noble birth” who ‘traveled to secure kingly power and then to return.’ (
                        <span id="citationsource196">

                        </a>
                        ) And, finally, they wonder what “the conclusion of the system of things” will involve.

                    <p class="p10">
                        In his detailed response, Jesus provides a sign that identifies when the existing Jewish system
                        of things, including its temple, will end. But he provides more. This sign will help Christians
                        in the future to know when they are living during his “presence” and near the end of the entire
                        system of things on earth.

                    <p class="p11">
                        As the years go by, the apostles observe Jesus’ prophecy being fulfilled. Yes, many things that
                        he foretold start to occur in their lifetime. Thus, alert Christians who are living 37 years
                        later, in 70 C.E., are not caught unawares by the approaching destruction of the Jewish system
                        with its temple. However, not all that Jesus foretells actually takes place in the period
                        leading up to and including 70 C.E. Hence, what will yet mark his presence in Kingdom power?
                        Jesus reveals the answer to the apostles.

                    <p class="p12">
                        Jesus foretells that there will be “wars and reports of wars” and that “nation will rise against
                        nation and kingdom against kingdom.” (

                        </a>
                        ) He also says that “there will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food
                        shortages and pestilences.” (
                        <span id="citationsource198">

                        </a>
                        ) Jesus warns his disciples: “People will lay their hands on you and persecute you.” (

                        ) False prophets will arise and mislead many. Lawlessness will increase, and the love of the
                        greater number will grow cold. Additionally, he says that the “good news of the Kingdom will be
                        preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will
                        come.”​—

                        Although Jesus’ prophecy is fulfilled in some respects prior to and during the destruction of
                        Jerusalem by the Romans, might Jesus be including a later, larger fulfillment? Do you see the
                        evidence that Jesus’ momentous prophecy has been undergoing its major fulfillment in modern
                        times?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p14">
                        One thing that Jesus includes in the sign of his presence is the appearance of “the disgusting
                        thing that causes desolation.” (
                        <span id="citationsource201">

                            Matthew 24:15
                        </a>
                        ) In 66 C.E., this disgusting thing appears in the form of the “encamped armies” of Rome, with
                        their idolatrous standards, or ensigns. The Romans surround Jerusalem and undermine some of its
                        walls. (
                        <span id="citationsource202">

                        </a>
                        ) Thus, “the disgusting thing” is standing where it ought not, in what the Jews consider “a holy
                        place.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="p15">
                        Jesus further foretells: “There will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the
                        world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” In 70 C.E., the Romans destroy
                        Jerusalem. That destructive conquest of the Jews’ ‘holy city,’ including its temple, proves to
                        be a great tribulation, with many thousands being killed. (

                        ) It is far greater than any destruction the city and the Jewish people have ever experienced,
                        and it brings to an end the organized system of worship that the Jews had followed for
                        centuries. Accordingly, any later, larger fulfillment of Jesus’ prophetic words is certain to be
                        horrific.

                        Christs and false prophets.” Attempts will be made, he says, “to mislead, if possible, even the
                        chosen ones.” (

                        Encouragingly, Jesus makes it clear to the apostles that not all will be lamenting when ‘the Son
                        of man comes with power and great glory.’ (

                        outlining? Jesus encourages his followers: “As these things start to occur, stand up straight
                        and lift up your heads, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—

                        How, though, would Jesus’ disciples who are living during this foretold period be able to
                        determine the nearness of the end? Jesus gives an illustration about a fig tree: “Just as soon
                        as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. Likewise
                        also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors. Truly I say to you
                        that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.”​—

                        should realize that the end is near. Admonishing the disciples who will be alive during that
                        momentous period, Jesus says:
                    </p>
                    <p class="p23">
                        “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but
                        only the Father. For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.
                        For as they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women
                        being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and they took no note
                        until the Flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (

                        ) The event that Jesus uses as a parallel​—the historic Flood of Noah’s day—​had a global
                        impact.

                        The apostles listening to Jesus on the Mount of Olives must undoubtedly recognize the need to
                        keep alert. Jesus says: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down
                        with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly
                        upon you as a snare. For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.
                        Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these
                        things that must occur and in standing before the Son of man.”​—

                        Jesus is once again showing that what he is foretelling is not of limited scope. He is not
                        prophesying about events that would occur in a few decades and that would affect only the city
                        of Jerusalem or the Jewish nation. No, he is pointing to developments that “will come upon all
                        those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.”

                        He says that his disciples will need to keep alert, to be on the watch, and to be ready. Jesus
                        underscores this warning with another illustration: “Know one thing: If the householder had
                        known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to
                        be broken into. On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is
                        coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.”​—

                        Jesus goes on to give his disciples reason for optimism. He assures them that when his prophecy
                        is being fulfilled, there will be a “slave” who is alert and active. Jesus draws on a situation
                        that the apostles can readily picture: “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his
                        master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? Happy is that
                        slave if his master on coming finds him doing so! Truly I say to you, he will appoint him over
                        all his belongings.” If, though, the “slave” develops an evil attitude and mistreats others, the
                        master will “punish him with the greatest severity.”​—

                        alert and active, as he makes clear in yet another illustration.

                        Jesus has been answering his apostles’ question regarding the sign of his presence and of the
                        conclusion of the system of things. With this in mind, he now gives them wise admonition by
                        means of an additional illustration. Its fulfillment would be observable by those living during
                        his presence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p6">
                        He introduces the illustration, saying: “The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten
                        virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and
                        five were discreet.”​—

                        .

                    <p class="p7">
                        Jesus does not mean that half of his disciples who inherit the Kingdom of the heavens are
                        foolish and the other half are discreet. Rather, he is making the point that in connection with
                        the Kingdom, each of his disciples has the capacity to choose to be vigilant or to be
                        distracted. Jesus has no doubt, though, that each of his servants can remain faithful and
                        receive his Father’s blessings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        In the illustration, all ten virgins go out to welcome the bridegroom and to join the wedding
                        procession. When he arrives, the virgins will light the route with their lamps, honoring him as
                        he brings his bride to the house prepared for her. How do things work out, though?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p9">
                        Jesus explains: “The foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them, whereas the discreet
                        took oil in their flasks along with their lamps. While the bridegroom was delaying, they all
                        became drowsy and fell asleep.” (
                        <span id="citationsource219">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) The bridegroom does not arrive as soon as expected. There seems to be a long delay, during
                        which the virgins fall asleep. The apostles may recall what Jesus related about a man of noble
                        birth who went away and
                        <em>
                            “eventually
                        </em>
                        got back after having secured the kingly power.”​—

                        In the illustration of the ten virgins, Jesus describes what happens when the bridegroom finally
                        arrives: “Right in the middle of the night there was a shout: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Go out to
                        meet him.’” (
                        <span id="citationsource221">

                        </a>
                        ) What is the situation of the virgins as to their preparedness and vigilance?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p11">
                        Jesus continues: “Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order. The foolish said
                        to the discreet, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’ The discreet
                        answered, saying: ‘Perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you. Go instead to those who
                        sell it, and buy some for yourselves.’”​—
                        <span id="citationsource222">

                    <p class="p12">
                        So the five foolish virgins are not vigilant and are not prepared for the arrival of the
                        bridegroom. They lack sufficient oil for their lamps and need to try to find some. Jesus
                        relates: “While they were going off to buy it, the bridegroom came. The virgins who were ready
                        went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward, the rest of the
                        virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, Sir, open to us!’ In answer he said, ‘I tell you the truth, I
                        do not know you.’” (
                        <span id="citationsource223">

                        </a>
                        ) What a sad outcome for not remaining prepared and vigilant!
                    </p>
                    <p class="p13">
                        The apostles can see that the bridegroom whom Jesus mentions refers to himself. Earlier he had
                        even likened himself to a bridegroom. (
                        <span id="citationsource224">

                        </a>
                        ) And the wise virgins? When speaking about the “little flock,” who would be given the Kingdom,
                        Jesus used the words: “Be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning.” (
                        <span id="citationsource225">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) So in this illustration about the virgins, the apostles can grasp that Jesus is referring to
                        ones such as themselves. Hence, what is the message that Jesus is conveying with this
                        illustration?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p14">
                        Jesus does not leave any doubt about that. He concludes his illustration by saying: “Keep on the
                        watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.”​—
                        <span id="citationsource227">

                    <p class="p15">
                        Clearly, Jesus is admonishing his faithful followers that in connection with his presence, they
                        will need to “keep on the watch.” He will be coming, and they need to be prepared and
                        vigilant​—like the five discreet virgins—​in order not to lose sight of their precious hope and
                        miss out on the reward that can be theirs.

                        illustration. A few days earlier, while he was at Jericho, he gave the illustration of the minas
                        to show that the Kingdom was yet far off in the future. The illustration he now relates has a
                        number of similar features. It is part of his answer to the question about his presence and the
                        conclusion of the system of things. It highlights that his disciples must be diligent with what
                        he entrusts to them.

                        ) Given that Jesus had already likened himself to a man who traveled abroad “to secure kingly
                        power for himself,” the apostles could easily see that Jesus is the “man” being spoken of now.​—

                        God’s Kingdom, and he trained his disciples to do this work. Now he is going away, confident
                        that they will carry on doing what he trained them to do.​—

                        In the illustration, how does the man distribute his belongings? Jesus relates: “He gave five
                        talents to one, two to another, and one to still another, to each according to his own ability,
                        and he went abroad.” (

                        ) What will these slaves do with what is entrusted to them? Will they be diligent in using them
                        in their master’s interests? Jesus tells the apostles:

                    <p class="p9">
                        “Immediately the one who received the five talents went and did business with them and gained
                        five more. Likewise, the one who received the two gained two more. But the slave who received
                        just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.” (

                        “After a long time,” Jesus continues, “the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with
                        them.” (

                        ) The first two did all they could, “each according to his own ability.” Each slave was
                        diligent, hardworking, and productive with what had been entrusted to him. The one who received
                        five talents doubled that, as did the one who received two talents. (Back then, a worker would
                        have to labor about 19 years to earn the equivalent of one talent.) The master has the same
                        commendation for each of them: “Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few
                        things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”​—

                        It is different, though, with the slave who received one talent. He says: “Master, I knew you to
                        be a demanding man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow. So I
                        grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.” (

                        ) He has not even deposited the money with bankers so as to accumulate at least some profit for
                        his master. He has, in effect, worked against his master’s interests.

                        Fittingly, the master designates him a “wicked and sluggish slave.” What he had is taken away
                        and given to the slave who is willing to apply himself diligently. The master sets out his
                        standard: “To everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But the one
                        who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”​—

                        Jesus’ disciples have much to think about, even in connection with this one illustration. They
                        can see that what Jesus is entrusting to them​—the precious privilege of making disciples—​is of
                        great value. And he expects them to be diligent in using this privilege. Jesus does not think
                        that they all must do the same in carrying out the preaching work that he has charged them to
                        do. As illustrated, each should do all that he can “according to his own ability.” This by no
                        means implies that Jesus will be pleased if one is “sluggish” and fails to do his best in
                        promoting the Master’s belongings.

                        When will this illustration find fulfillment? It is when Jesus “comes in his glory” with the
                        angels and sits down “on his glorious throne.” He had already spoken about “the Son of man
                        coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” and with his angels. When would that
                        be? “Immediately after the tribulation.” (

                        Jesus has been exposing them. Now they conspire together “to seize Jesus by cunning and to kill
                        him.” How and when will they do so? They say: “Not at the festival, so that there may not be an
                        uproar among the people.” (

                        apostles, Judas Iscariot. Satan has implanted in him the idea of betraying his Master! Judas
                        asks them: “What will you give me to betray him to you?” (

                        of a slave is 30 shekels. (

                        obtained so that it can be slaughtered and roasted whole after Nisan 14 begins. Where will they
                        have the meal, and who will prepare it? Jesus has not provided such details. Thus, Judas cannot

                        Jesus explains: “When you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet
                        you. Follow him into the house that he enters. And say to the landlord of the house, ‘The

                        had told them. So they see to it that the lamb is ready and that the other arrangements for the
                        Passover meal are in place to care for the needs of the 13​—Jesus and his 12 apostles.

                        Passover. Later Jesus and the ten other apostles head there. It is afternoon, and the sun is
                        sinking in the western sky as Jesus and his party descend the Mount of Olives. This is Jesus’
                        last daytime view from here until after his resurrection.

                        Passover meal. They climb the stairs to the large upper room. There they find that all
                        preparations have been made for their private meal. Jesus has looked forward to this occasion,
                        for he says: “I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.”​—

                        Many years earlier, the custom of passing a number of cups of wine among the Passover
                        participants was introduced. Now, after accepting one of the cups, Jesus gives thanks and says:
                        “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves, for I tell you, from now on, I
                        will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.” (

                        At some point during the Passover meal, something unusual occurs. Jesus gets up, sets aside his
                        outer garments, and picks up a towel. Then he puts water in a basin that is at hand. Ordinarily,
                        a host would see to it that his guests’ feet were washed, perhaps by a servant. (

                        </a>
                        ) On this occasion no host is present, so Jesus performs this personal service. Any of the
                        apostles could have taken the opportunity to do it, but not one of them does. Is it because some
                        rivalry still exists among them? Whatever the case, they are embarrassed to have Jesus wash
                        their feet.

                        When Jesus comes to Peter, he protests: “You will certainly never wash my feet.” Jesus replies:
                        “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Peter responds with feeling: “Lord, wash not
                        only my feet but also my hands and my head.” How surprised he must be, then, at Jesus’ answer:
                        “Whoever has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is completely clean.
                        And you men are clean, but not all of you.”​—

                        you? You address me as ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are correct, for I am such. Therefore, if
                        I, the Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also should wash the feet of one another. For I
                        set the pattern for you, that just as I did to you, you should also do. Most truly I say to you,

                        him. If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.”​—

                        example, not by any ritual of foot washing, but by being willing to serve with humility and
                        without partiality.

                        apparently after the Passover meal, he quotes David’s prophetic words: “The man at peace with

                        takes a loaf, says a prayer of thanks, breaks it, and gives it to his apostles to eat. He says:

                        During his last evening with his apostles, Jesus has provided them with a fine lesson in humble
                        service by washing their feet. Why is that fitting? Because of a weakness they have shown. They
                        are devoted to God, yet they still are concerned about which of them is greatest. (

                        them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are
                        called Benefactors. You, though, are not to be that way. . . . For which one is greater, the one
                        dining or the one serving?” Then, reminding them of the example that he has constantly set for
                        them, Jesus says: “But I am among you as the one serving.”​—

                        me, for a kingdom.” (

                        and them, they will be in the Kingdom and share in his royal dominion.

                        imperfect. Jesus tells them: “Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat,” which
                        scatters as it is sifted. (

                        However, Jesus adds: “I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and

                        “I am the way and the truth and the life,” Jesus answers. Only by accepting him and his
                        teachings and imitating his life course can one enter the heavenly house of his Father. Jesus
                        says: “No one comes to the Father except through me.”​—

                        Philip, listening intently, requests: “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”
                        Philip seems to want some manifestation of God, like the visions that Moses, Elijah, and Isaiah
                        received. However, the apostles have something better than such visions. Jesus highlights that,
                        replying: “Even after I have been with you men for such a long time, Philip, have you not come
                        to know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” Jesus perfectly reflects the Father’s
                        personality; hence, living with and observing Jesus is like seeing the Father. Of course, the
                        Father is superior to the Son, for Jesus points out: “The things I say to you I do not speak of
                        my own originality.” (

                        ) The apostles can see that Jesus is giving all credit for his teachings to his Father.

                        Jesus’ apostles have seen him do wonderful works and have heard him proclaim the good news about
                        the Kingdom of God. Now he tells them: “Whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works
                        that I do; and he will do works greater than these.” (

                        carry out their ministry for a much longer time, over a much greater area, and to far more
                        people.

                        helper to be with you forever, the spirit of the truth.” (

                        the day of Pentecost.

                        Now Jesus states a simple truth: “Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who
                        loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will
                        clearly show myself to him.” At this the apostle Judas, who is also called Thaddaeus, asks:
                        “Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world?”
                        Jesus replies: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him . . .
                        Whoever does not love me does not observe my words.” (

                        ) Unlike his followers, the world does not recognize Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life.

                        Jesus is going away, so how will his disciples be able to recall all that he taught them? Jesus
                        explains: “The helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will
                        teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.” The apostles have
                        seen how powerfully the holy spirit can work, so this assurance is comforting. Jesus adds: “I
                        leave you peace; I give you my peace. . . . Do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them
                        shrink out of fear.” (

                        ) The disciples have reason, then, not to be troubled​—they will have direction and protection
                        from Jesus’ Father.

                    <p class="p16">
                        Evidence of God’s protection will soon be seen. Jesus says: “The ruler of the world is coming,
                        and he has no hold on me.” (

                        ) The Devil was able to enter into Judas and get a hold on him. But there is no sinful weakness
                        in Jesus that Satan can play on to turn him against God. Nor will the Devil be able to restrain
                        Jesus in death. Why not? Jesus states: “I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do.”
                        He is certain that his Father will resurrect him.​—

                        Jesus has been encouraging his faithful apostles in a heart-to-heart talk. It is late, perhaps
                        past midnight. Jesus now presents a motivating illustration:
                    </p>
                    <p class="p7">
                        “I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator,” he begins. (

                            John 15:1
                        </a>
                        ) His illustration resembles what had been said centuries earlier about the nation of Israel,
                        which was called Jehovah’s vine. (
                        <span id="citationsource336">
                        </span>
                        <a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation336">

                        <span id="citationsource337">

                            Hosea 10:1, 2
                        </a>
                        ) However, Jehovah is casting off that nation. (
                        <span id="citationsource338">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) So Jesus is introducing a new thought. He is the vine that his Father has been cultivating
                        since anointing Jesus with holy spirit in 29 C.E. But Jesus shows that the vine symbolizes more
                        than just him, saying:
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        “[My Father] takes away every branch in me not bearing fruit, and he cleans every one bearing
                        fruit, so that it may bear more fruit. . . . Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
                        unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in union with me. I am the
                        vine; you are the branches.”​—

                        Jesus has promised his faithful disciples that after he goes away, he would send a helper, the
                        holy spirit. Fifty-one days later, when the apostles and others receive that spirit, they become
                        branches of the vine. And all the “branches” would have to remain united with Jesus. To
                        accomplish what?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p10">
                        He explains: “Whoever remains in union with me and I in union with him, this one bears much
                        fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing at all.” These “branches”​—his faithful
                        followers—​would bear much fruit, imitating Jesus’ qualities, actively speaking to others about
                        God’s Kingdom, and making more disciples. What if one does not remain in union with Jesus and
                        does not bear fruit? Jesus explains: “If anyone does not remain in union with me, he is thrown
                        out.” On the other hand, Jesus says: “If you remain in union with me and my sayings remain in
                        you, ask whatever you wish and it will take place for you.”​—

                        ) He describes a key way for disciples to prove that they are doing so: “If you observe my
                        commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father
                        and remain in his love.” However, more is involved than loving Jehovah God and his Son. Jesus
                        says: “This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you. No one has
                        love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends. You are
                        my friends if you do what I am commanding you.”​—

                    <p class="p12">
                        In a few hours, Jesus will demonstrate his love by giving his life for all who exercise faith in
                        him. His example should move his followers to have similar self-sacrificing love for one
                        another. This love will identify them, as Jesus stated earlier: “By this all will know that you
                        are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.”​—

                        The apostles should take note of Jesus’ calling them “friends.” He relates why they are such: “I
                        have called you friends, because I have made known to you all the things I have heard from my
                        Father.” What a precious relationship to have​—to be intimate friends of Jesus and to know what
                        the Father told him! In order to enjoy this relationship, though, they must “keep bearing
                        fruit.” If they do, Jesus says, “no matter what you ask the Father in my name he [will] give it
                        to you.”​—

                        The love among these “branches,” his disciples, will help them to endure what is to come. He
                        warns them that the world will hate them, yet he offers this comfort: “If the world hates you,
                        you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were part of the world, the world
                        would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, . . . for this

                        Explaining further why the world will hate them, Jesus adds: “They will do all these things
                        against you on account of my name, because they do not know the One who sent me.” Jesus says
                        that his miraculous works, in effect, convict those who hate him: “If I had not done among them
                        the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen me and hated
                        me as well as my Father.” Actually, their hatred fulfills prophecy.​—

                        Jesus and the apostles are poised to leave the upper room where they held the Passover meal.
                        Having given them considerable admonition, Jesus adds: “I have said these things to you so that
                        you may not be stumbled.” Why was such a warning appropriate? He tells them: “Men will expel you
                        from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has
                        offered a sacred service to God.”​—

                        That may be troubling news for the apostles. Although Jesus had said earlier that the world
                        would hate them, he had not directly told them that they would be killed. Why not? “I did not
                        tell you these things at first, because I was with you,” he says. (

                        they fail to ask further about the glory that awaits him or what that would mean for true
                        worshippers. Jesus observes: “Because I have told you these things, grief has filled your

                        heaven will provide convincing evidence of his righteousness and will demonstrate why Satan,
                        “the ruler of this world,” merits adverse judgment.​—

                        realizes that they want to question him about this, so he explains: “Most truly I say to you,
                        you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be grieved, but your grief will be
                        turned into joy.” (

                        Comparing the apostles’ situation to that of a woman during birth pangs, Jesus says: “When a
                        woman is giving birth, she has grief because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to
                        the child, she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born
                        into the world.” Jesus encourages his apostles, saying: “You also, now you have grief; but I
                        will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.”​—

                        is reluctant to respond. In fact, Jesus says: “The Father himself has affection for you, because
                        you have had affection for me . . . as God’s representative.”​—

                        just ahead: “Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when each one of you will be
                        scattered to his own house and you will leave me alone.” Yet he assures them: “I have said these
                        things to you so that by means of me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation,
                        but take courage! I have conquered the world.” (

                        is, by their faithfully accomplishing God’s will despite the attempts of Satan and his world to
                        break their integrity.

                        Moved by deep love for his apostles, Jesus has been preparing them for his imminent departure.
                        He now raises his eyes to heaven and prays to his Father: “Glorify your son so that your son may
                        glorify you, just as you have given him authority over all flesh, so that he may give
                        everlasting life to all those whom you have given to him.”​—

                        Clearly, Jesus recognizes that giving God glory is of prime importance. But how comforting is
                        the prospect that Jesus mentions​—everlasting life! Having received “authority over all flesh,”
                        Jesus can offer the benefits of his ransom to all mankind. Yet, only some will be so blessed.
                        Why only some? Because Jesus will impart the benefits of his ransom only to those who act in
                        accord with what Jesus next mentions: “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you,
                        the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”​—

                        qualities in dealing with others. And he must appreciate that humans’ receiving everlasting life
                        is secondary to the glorification of God. Jesus now returns to this theme:

                    <p class="p9">
                        “I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do. So now,

                        ) Yes, Jesus asks to be restored to heavenly glory by means of a resurrection.

                        However, Jesus has not forgotten what he has accomplished in his ministry. He prays: “I have
                        made your name manifest to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you
                        gave them to me, and they have observed your word.” (

                        ) Jesus did more than pronounce God’s name, Jehovah, in his ministry. He helped his apostles to
                        come to know what the name represents​—God’s qualities and his way of dealing with humans.

                        Jesus humbly says: “I have given them the sayings that you gave me, and they have accepted them
                        and have certainly come to know that I came as your representative, and they have believed that

                        because they are yours . . . Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name, which you
                        have given me, so that they may be one just as we are one. . . . I have protected them, and not

                        “The world has hated them,” Jesus continues to pray. “I do not request that you take them out of
                        the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one. They are no part of the
                        world, just as I am no part of the world.” (

                        ) The apostles and other disciples are in the world, human society ruled by Satan, but they must
                        remain separate from it and its badness. How?

                    <p class="p14">
                        They must keep themselves holy, set apart to serve God, by applying the truths found in the
                        Hebrew Scriptures and the truths that Jesus himself has taught. Jesus prays: “Sanctify them by
                        means of the truth; your word is truth.” (

                        </a>
                        ) In time, some of the apostles will write inspired books that will also be part of “the truth”
                        that can help to sanctify a person.

                    <p class="p15">
                        But there will in time be others who will accept “the truth.” Jesus thus prays “not concerning
                        these only [those who are there], but also concerning those putting faith in [him] through their
                        word.” What does Jesus request for all of them? “That they may all be one, just as you, Father,
                        are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us.” (

                        ) Jesus and his Father are not literally one person. They are one in that they are in agreement
                        on all things. Jesus prays that his followers enjoy this same oneness.

                    <p class="p16">
                        Shortly before this, Jesus had told Peter and the others that he was going his way to prepare a
                        place for them, meaning a place in heaven. (
                        <span id="citationsource378">
                        </span>

                            John 14:2, 3
                        </a>
                        ) Jesus now returns to that idea in prayer: “Father, I want those whom you have given me to be
                        with me where I am, in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me, because
                        you loved me before the founding of the world.” (

                        </a>
                        ) He thus confirms that long ago​—before Adam and Eve conceived offspring—​God loved his
                        only-begotten Son, who became Jesus Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p17">
                        Concluding his prayer, Jesus reemphasizes both his Father’s name and God’s love for the apostles
                        and for others who will yet accept “the truth,” saying: “I have made your name known to them and
                        will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with
                        them.”​—

                        Once they arrive at this pleasant spot among the olive trees, Jesus leaves eight of the apostles
                        behind. Perhaps they remain near the garden’s entrance, for he tells them: “Sit down here while
                        I go over there and pray.” Taking along three apostles​—Peter, James, and John—​Jesus goes
                        farther into the garden. He becomes greatly troubled and tells the three: “I am deeply grieved,
                        even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.”​—

                        awaits him. More important, though, he is in agony because he senses that his dying like a
                        despicable criminal might bring reproach on his Father’s name. In a few hours, he will be hanged

                        “Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me? Keep on the watch and pray
                        continually, so that you may not enter into temptation.” Jesus realizes that the apostles too
                        have been under stress, and it is late. He adds: “The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh
                        is weak.”​—

                        Father’s name. Jehovah is hearing his Son’s prayers, though, and at one point God sends an angel
                        to strengthen him. Even so, Jesus does not stop supplicating his Father, but he keeps “praying
                        more earnestly.” The emotional stress is enormous. What a weight is on Jesus’ shoulders! His own
                        eternal life and that of believing humans is at stake. In fact, his ‘sweat becomes as drops of

                        It is well past midnight. The priests have agreed to pay Judas 30 pieces of silver to betray
                        Jesus. So Judas leads a large crowd of chief priests and Pharisees, seeking to find Jesus. They
                        are accompanied by a detachment of armed Roman soldiers with a military commander.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p8">
                        Evidently, when Jesus dismissed him from the Passover meal, Judas went directly to the chief
                        priests. (
                        <span id="citationsource399">

                        </a>
                        ) They assembled their own officers as well as a band of soldiers. Judas may have led them first
                        to the room where Jesus and his apostles had celebrated the Passover. But now the mob has
                        crossed the Kidron Valley and is headed for the garden. In addition to weapons, they are
                        carrying lamps and torches, determined to find Jesus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p9">
                        As Judas leads the procession up the Mount of Olives, he feels sure that he knows where to find
                        Jesus. During the past week, as Jesus and the apostles traveled back and forth between Bethany
                        and Jerusalem, they often stopped in the garden of Gethsemane. But now it is night, and Jesus
                        may be in the shadows of the olive trees in the garden. So how will the soldiers, who may not
                        have seen Jesus before, be able to identify him? To help them, Judas will provide a sign. He
                        says: “Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one; take him into custody, and lead him away under
                        guard.”​—

                        Leading the crowd into the garden, Judas sees Jesus with his apostles and goes straight up to
                        him. “Greetings, Rabbi!” Judas says, and he kisses Jesus very tenderly. “Fellow, for what
                        purpose are you present?” Jesus responds. (

                        ) Answering his own question, Jesus says: “Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?”
                        (
                        <span id="citationsource402">

                    <p class="p11">
                        Jesus now steps into the light of the torches and lamps and asks: “Whom are you looking for?”
                        From the mob comes the answer: “Jesus the Nazarene.” Jesus courageously says: “I am he.” (

                    <p class="p12">
                        Rather than seizing that moment to flee into the night, Jesus again asks whom they are seeking.
                        When they again say, “Jesus the Nazarene,” he calmly continues: “I told you that I am he. So if
                        you are looking for me, let these men go.” Even at this crucial moment, Jesus recalls what he
                        said earlier, that he would not lose a single one. (

                        ) Jesus has kept his faithful apostles and not one has been lost “except the son of
                        destruction”​—Judas. (

                        ) Thus he now asks that his loyal followers be let go.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p13">
                        As the soldiers stand and move toward Jesus, the apostles realize what is happening. “Lord,
                        should we strike with the sword?” they ask. (

                        </a>
                        ) Before Jesus can reply, Peter wields one of the two swords that the apostles have at hand. He
                        attacks Malchus, a slave of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.

                    <p class="p14">
                        Jesus touches the ear of Malchus, healing the wound. He then teaches an important lesson,
                        commanding Peter: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will
                        perish by the sword.” Jesus is willing to be arrested, for he explains: “How would the
                        Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way?” (

                        Mark—​remains among the crowd so as to follow Jesus. (

                        young Jesus amazed the teachers at the temple. (

                        position.

                        While Jesus is at the home of Annas, Caiaphas has time to assemble the Sanhedrin. That court of
                        71 members includes the high priest and others who had held that office.

                    <p class="p8">
                        Annas questions Jesus “about his disciples and about his teaching.” Jesus replies simply: “I
                        have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all
                        the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who
                        have heard what I told them.”​—

                        An officer standing there slaps Jesus in the face and says reprovingly: “Is that the way you
                        answer the chief priest?” But Jesus, knowing that he has done no wrong, responds: “If I said
                        something wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said was right, why do you hit me?”

                        By now those composing the whole Sanhedrin​—the current high priest, the elders of the people,
                        and the scribes—​have assembled. They meet at the home of Caiaphas. It is illegal to hold such a
                        trial on the night of Passover, but this does not deter them from pursuing their wicked purpose.

                    <p class="p11">
                        This is hardly an unbiased group. After Jesus resurrected Lazarus, the Sanhedrin decided that
                        Jesus should die. (

                        ) And just days ago the religious authorities conspired to seize Jesus and kill him. (

                        ) Yes, even before his trial begins, Jesus is as good as condemned to death!

                        In addition to meeting illegally, the chief priests and others of the Sanhedrin are attempting
                        to find witnesses who will give false evidence to build the case against Jesus. They find many,
                        but these cannot agree as to their testimony. Finally, two come forward and claim: “We heard him
                        say, ‘I will throw down this temple that was made with hands, and in three days I will build
                        another not made with hands.’” (

                        </a>
                        ) Yet even these men do not fully agree.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p13">
                        Caiaphas asks Jesus: “Do you say nothing in reply? What is it these men are testifying against
                        you?” (
                        <span id="citationsource426">

                        </a>
                        ) Jesus remains silent in the face of this false charge made by witnesses whose stories
                        disagree. So High Priest Caiaphas switches to a different tactic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p14">
                        Caiaphas knows that the Jews are sensitive about anyone claiming to be the Son of God. Earlier,
                        when Jesus had called God his Father, the Jews wanted to kill him because they claimed that he
                        was “making himself equal to God.” (
                        <span id="citationsource427">

                        </a>
                        ) Aware of such sentiments, Caiaphas now craftily demands of Jesus: “I put you under oath by the
                        living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God!” (
                        <span id="citationsource429">

                        ) Of course, Jesus has acknowledged being the Son of God. (

                        Christ. So Jesus says: “I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power
                        and coming with the clouds of heaven.”​—

                        Upon Jesus’ being arrested in the garden of Gethsemane, the apostles abandon him, fleeing in
                        fear. However, two of them stop their flight. They are Peter “as well as another disciple,”
                        evidently the apostle John. (

                        ) They may catch up with Jesus as he is taken to the home of Annas. When Annas sends Jesus to
                        High Priest Caiaphas, Peter and John follow at a distance. They are likely torn between fear for
                        their own lives and concern for what will happen to their Master.

                        John is known to the high priest and is thus able to gain entrance into the courtyard at
                        Caiaphas’ house. Peter remains outside at the door until John returns and speaks to a servant
                        girl who is acting as doorkeeper. Then Peter is allowed to enter.

                    <p class="p7">
                        It is cold this night, so those in the courtyard have a charcoal fire burning. Peter sits with
                        them to keep warm as he waits “to see the outcome” of Jesus’ trial. (

                        ) Now, in the light of the fire, the doorkeeper who let Peter in gets a better look at him. “You
                        are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” she demands. (

                        This greatly upsets Peter. He is trying to be inconspicuous, even withdrawing to the entryway.
                        So Peter denies that he was with Jesus, at one point saying: “Neither do I know him nor do I

                        the courtyard. Peter and the others waiting below may see the comings and goings of various
                        witnesses who are brought in to testify.

                        Peter’s Galilean accent is an indication that his denial is false. Moreover, one in the group is
                        related to Malchus, whose ear Peter cut off. So the charge is leveled against Peter: “I saw you
                        in the garden with him, did I not?” When Peter denies this for a third time, a rooster crows, as
                        was foretold.​—

                        At that point, Jesus apparently is on a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The Lord turns and
                        looks straight at Peter, which must pierce Peter to the core. He recalls what Jesus said only a
                        few hours earlier in the upper room. Imagine how Peter feels as the realization of what he has
                        done crashes down on him! Peter goes outside and weeps bitterly.​—

                        criminal. When Peter could have stood up for an innocent man, he turned his back on the very One
                        who has “sayings of everlasting life.”​—

                        King of the Jews?” In other words, ‘Have you broken the law of the empire by declaring yourself
                        to be a king in opposition to Caesar?’ Perhaps to find out how much Pilate already has heard

                        Pilate does not leave the issue at that. He asks: “Well, then, are you a king?” Jesus lets

                        am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should
                        bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.”​—

                        Jesus had earlier told Thomas: “I am the way and the truth and the life.” Now even Pilate hears

                        the truth about his Kingdom. Jesus is determined to be faithful to that truth even if it costs
                        him his life. Pilate asks: “What is truth?” but he does not wait for further explanation. He
                        feels that he has heard enough to judge this man.​—

                        Pilate returns to the crowd waiting outside the palace. Jesus apparently is at his side when he
                        tells the chief priests and those with them: “I find no crime in this man.” Angered by that
                        decision, the crowd insists: “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, starting
                        from Galilee even to here.”​—

                        The Jews’ unreasoning fanaticism must amaze Pilate. As the chief priests and older men continue
                        shouting, Pilate asks Jesus: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”

                        Pilate.

                        The Jews indicated that Jesus had ‘started from Galilee.’ Pursuing that clue, Pilate learns that
                        Jesus is, in fact, a Galilean. This gives Pilate an idea of how he might escape responsibility
                        for judging Jesus. Herod Antipas (the son of Herod the Great) is the ruler of Galilee, and he is
                        in Jerusalem this Passover season. So Pilate sends Jesus to Herod. It was Herod Antipas who had
                        John the Baptist beheaded. Later, at hearing that Jesus was performing miraculous works, Herod
                        was concerned that Jesus might be John raised from the dead.​—

                        Herod now rejoices at the prospect of seeing Jesus. This is not because he wants to help Jesus
                        or wishes to make any real attempt to learn whether there are valid charges against him. Herod
                        is simply curious, and he is “hoping to see some sign performed by him.” (
                        <span id="citationsource483">

                        ) However, Jesus does not satisfy Herod’s curiosity. In fact, as Herod questions him, Jesus says
                        not a word. Disappointed, both Herod and his soldiers treat Jesus “with contempt.” (

                        ) They clothe him with a splendid garment and mock him. Then Herod sends Jesus back to Pilate.
                        Herod and Pilate had been enemies, but now they become good friends.

                        are bringing against him. In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and look! he
                        has done nothing deserving of death. I will therefore punish him and release him.”​—

                                leather thongs and sheep bones would cut into the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Then,

                        before the Sanhedrin. “We have a law,” they say, “and according to the law he ought to die,
                        because he made himself God’s son.” (

                        knows that Jesus is from Galilee. (

                        reply stings Pilate’s pride, and he indignantly says to Jesus: “Are you refusing to speak to me?
                        Do you not know that I have authority to release you and I have authority to execute you?”​—

                        his accomplices, and Judas Iscariot bear a heavier responsibility than Pilate does.

                        must have. They threaten: “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who
                        makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”​—

                        under Roman rule; still, the chief priests boldly assert: “We have no king but Caesar.”​—

                        weight of the stake, Jesus’ strength gives out. So the soldiers force a passerby, Simon from
                        Cyrene in Africa, to carry the stake to the place of execution. Many people follow, some beating
                        themselves in grief and bewailing what is happening.

                        will start saying to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’ If they

                        a seam, being woven from top to bottom.” The soldiers reason: “Let us not tear it, but let us
                        cast lots over it to decide whose it will be.” They thus fulfill the scripture that says: “They

                                    garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from top to bottom.

                        It is getting late on Friday afternoon, Nisan 14. At sundown, the Sabbath of Nisan 15 will
                        begin. Jesus is already dead, but the two robbers alongside him are still alive. According to
                        the Law, dead bodies “should not remain all night on the stake” but, rather, should be buried
                        “on that day.”​—

                        and ‘do obeisance to him.’ Then Jesus says: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers so that

                        to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your
                        Father and to my God and your God.’”​—

                    In ancient Israel the Passover was held annually on the 14th day of the first month, named Nisan

                    sacrifice to Jehovah. In the second month [named Iyyar, or Ziv], on the fourteenth day between the

                    meal in the second month was limited. It was an exception for an Israelite who was ceremonially

                    The only recorded instance of this being widely used was at the time when faithful King Hezekiah
                    revived the observance of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes. There was no time to get ready for the
                    first month (the priests not being ready nor the people gathered), so it was held on the 14th day of
                    the second month.​—

                    and wine to the sick one, discuss appropriate Bible texts on the subject, and serve the emblems. If
                    an anointed Christian is away from his home congregation, he should arrange to go to a congregation

                    them is sick or is traveling and thus not with any congregation that evening, he or she could
                    privately read over appropriate scriptures (including the account of Jesus’ instituting the
                    celebration) and pray for Jehovah’s blessing on the event worldwide. But in this case there is no
                    need for any additional arrangement for a meeting or a special Biblical discussion a month later.

                    Later, when David was king in Jerusalem, he expressed a strong desire to build a permanent house to
                    Jehovah’s glory. Since David had been a man of war, however, Jehovah told him: “You will not build a
                    house to my name.” Instead, He chose David’s son Solomon to build the temple. (
                    <span id="citationsource5">

                    </a>
                    ) Solomon inaugurated the temple in 1026 B.C.E., after a construction period lasting seven and a
                    half years. Jehovah approved of this building, saying: “I have sanctified this house that you have
                    built by putting my name there to time indefinite; and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to
                    be there always.” (
                    <span id="citationsource6">

                    </a>
                    ) As long as the Israelites remained faithful, Jehovah would direct his favor toward that house.
                    However, if they turned aside from what was right, Jehovah would remove his favor from that place,
                    and ‘the house itself would become heaps of ruins.’​—

                    and Jerusalem, at times stripping the temple of its treasures. The temple also suffered periods of
                    neglect. King Shishak of Egypt robbed it of its treasures (993 B.C.E.) in the days of Rehoboam the
                    son of Solomon, only about 33 years after its inauguration. (

                    bribed King Ben-hadad I of Syria, with silver and gold from the treasures of the temple, to break

                        SOLOMON became king of Israel when he was just a young man. In the early part of his reign,
                        Jehovah appeared to him in a dream and said: “Ask what you would like me to give you.” Solomon
                        replied: “I am just a youth and I am inexperienced. . . . So grant your servant an obedient
                        heart to judge your people.” (

                        Consider how our physical health illustrates the importance of who we are on the inside. First,
                        to keep ourselves in good condition on the inside, we must choose a healthy diet, and we need to
                        exercise regularly. Likewise, to keep ourselves in good spiritual condition, we must choose a
                        healthy diet of spiritual food and regularly exercise our faith in Jehovah. That form of
                        exercise involves applying what we learn and speaking about our faith. (

                        actually diseased on the inside. In a similar way, based on our theocratic routine, we may think
                        that our faith is strong, but wrong desires could be growing in us. (

                        in other ways. For example, he surrounds us with people who are already corrupted by him. (

                        Satan uses movies and television shows to spread his way of thinking. He understands that
                        storytelling does much more than entertain us; it teaches us how to think, feel, and act. Jesus
                        made good use of this method of teaching. Take, for example, his parables of the neighborly
                        Samaritan and of the son who left home and wasted his inheritance. (

                        need to be balanced. Movies and TV shows can entertain and educate us without contaminating our
                        thinking. But we must be cautious. When choosing entertainment, we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Is
                        this movie or TV show teaching me that it is all right to give in to my fleshly desires?’ (

                        You keep your home clean, and you throw out anything that might cause you or your children to
                        get sick. In the same way, you need to protect your children from movies, TV shows, electronic
                        games, and websites that are likely to infect them with Satan’s thinking. Jehovah has given you
                        the authority to care for the spiritual health of your children. (

                        reminds us of the work done by a watchman. In King Solomon’s day, watchmen stood guard on the
                        walls of a city and sounded an alarm if they saw danger approaching. That mental picture helps
                        us understand what we must do to stop Satan from corrupting our thinking.

                        ) Together, they helped protect the city by making sure that the gates were closed whenever an

                        sounds the alarm, we need to listen and shut the gate, so to speak.

                        Consider an example of how we can protect ourselves from being influenced by Satan’s thinking.
                        Jehovah has taught us that “sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness [should] not even be
                        mentioned among [us].” (
                        <span id="citationsource39">

                        </a>
                        ) But what will we do if peers at work or at school start talking about sexually immoral topics?
                        We know that we should “reject ungodliness and worldly desires.” (
                        <span id="citationsource40">

                            Titus 2:12
                        </a>
                        ) The watchman, our conscience, might sound an alarm. (

                        </a>
                        ) But will we listen to it? We might be tempted, instead, to listen to our peers or to look at
                        pictures they might be sharing. But this is the time to close the city gates, so to speak, by
                        changing the conversation or by walking away.

                        It takes courage to resist pressure from our peers to think about or to do wrong things. We can
                        be sure that Jehovah sees the effort we make, and he will give us the strength and wisdom we
                        need to resist satanic thinking. (

                        To safeguard our heart, we must not only close it to wrong influences but also open it to
                        positive influences. Think again about the illustration of a walled city. A gatekeeper closed
                        the gates of the city to stop an enemy invasion, but at other times he opened the gates to allow
                        food and other supplies to be brought in. If the gates were never open, the inhabitants of the
                        city would starve. Similarly, we need to open our heart regularly to the influence of God’s
                        thinking.

                        The Bible contains Jehovah’s thinking, so each time we read it, we allow Jehovah’s thoughts to
                        affect the way we think, feel, and act. How can we get the most from our Bible reading? Prayer
                        is vital. One Christian sister says: “Before I read the Bible, I pray to Jehovah, asking that he
                        help me ‘see clearly the wonderful things’ in his Word.” (
                        <span id="citationsource46">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) We also need to meditate on what we read. When we pray, read, and meditate, God’s Word reaches
                        “deep within [our] heart,” and we come to love Jehovah’s thinking.​—

                    ) It appears to have been located in “the Porch of the Throne,” one of the buildings that stood on
                    Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. (
                    <span id="citationsource13">

                    ) It was ‘a great ivory throne overlaid with refined gold with a round canopy behind it and
                    armrests.’ Although ivory could have been the basic material in this royal chair, the construction
                    technique generally followed at the temple would seem to indicate that it was made of wood, overlaid
                    with refined gold and richly ornamented with inlaid panels of ivory. To the observer, such a throne
                    would appear to be made entirely of ivory and gold. After mentioning six steps leading to the
                    throne, the record continues: “Two lions were standing beside the armrests. And there were twelve
                    lions standing there upon the six steps, on this side and on that side.” (

                            the needs of a mate. Thus, they generally have more freedom. For example, some are able to
                            expand their ministry in interesting ways, such as by traveling to another land to preach
                            the good news. Above all, they can spend more time drawing close to Jehovah.

                            Couples who legally marry make a commitment to love, respect, and cherish each other. As a
                            result, they often feel more secure than do couples who simply live together. And marriage
                            provides a secure foundation for raising a family.

                            alive. He allows divorce only when a mate is guilty of adultery. In such a case, Jehovah
                            gives the innocent mate the right to decide whether he or she will get a divorce.

                            In some cultures, parents choose a marriage mate for their son or daughter. When that is the

                            spouse, but whether he or she loves Jehovah.

                        According to the ancient Greek geographer Strabo, the people of Sheba were enormously wealthy.
                        He says that they made lavish use of gold in their furniture, their utensils, and even on the
                        walls, doors, and roofs of their homes.

                    The queen of Sheba was so impressed with Solomon’s wisdom and the prosperity of his kingdom that
                    there was “no more spirit in her.” (

                    she fainted! Be that as it may, the queen was amazed at what she had seen and heard. She pronounced
                    Solomon’s servants happy for being able to hear this king’s wisdom, and she blessed Jehovah for
                    putting Solomon on the throne. Then she gave the king costly gifts, the gold alone totaling, by
                    modern values, some $40,000,000. Solomon too presented gifts, giving the queen “all her delight for
                    which she asked.”

                    the Israelites from making “sacrifices to the goat-shaped demons” (

                    particularly in Lower Egypt. Herodotus (II, 46) claims that from such Egyptian worship the Greeks
                    derived their belief in Pan and also in the satyrs, woodland gods of a lustful nature, who were
                    eventually depicted as having horns, a goat’s tail, and goat’s legs. Some suggest that such
                    half-animal form of these pagan gods is the source of the practice of picturing Satan with tail,
                    horns, and cloven feet, a custom prevalent among professed Christians in the Dark Ages.

                    the form of goats, this does not necessarily seem to be indicated; nor do other scriptures provide
                    evidence of that nature. The term used may simply indicate that

                    such false gods were conceived of as being goatlike in shape or hairy in appearance. Or, the use of
                    “goats” in these references may be merely a means of expressing contempt for all idolatrous objects
                    in general, even as the word for idols in numerous texts is drawn from a term originally meaning
                    “dung pellets,” not denoting, however, that the idols were literally made of dung.​—

                        When a Bible student or a fellow believer asks what he should do in a given situation, how
                        should you answer? You may know what you would personally do. But each person must bear
                        responsibility for his own decisions in life. (

                        <a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation19">
                            Gal. 6:5
                        </a>
                        ) The apostle Paul explained that he encouraged “obedience by faith” among the people to whom he
                        preached. (
                        <span id="citationsource20">
                        </span>
                        <a epub:type="noteref" href="#citation20">

                        </a>
                        ) That is a fine example for us to follow. A person who makes decisions mainly to please his
                        Bible teacher or another human is serving men, not living by faith. (
                        <span id="citationsource21">
                        </span>

                        </a>
                        ) So a simple, direct answer may not be in the best interests of the one who is making the
                        inquiry.

                        How, then, could you reply in a manner that is consistent with the Bible’s guidelines? You might
                        draw attention to appropriate Bible principles and examples included in the Bible record. In
                        some cases, you might show him how to do research so as to find those principles and examples
                        himself. You could even discuss the principles and the value of the examples but without
                        applying them to the situation at hand. Ask the person if he sees in them something that might
                        help him to make a wise decision. Encourage him to consider in the light of these principles and
                        examples what course would be pleasing to Jehovah. You are thus helping him to ‘train his own
                        perceptive powers to distinguish both right and wrong.’​—

                        Rehoboam may have felt trapped! If he met the people’s demands, he, his family, and those of his
                        court might have to cut back on some luxuries and make fewer demands on the people. On the other
                        hand, if he refused, the people might rebel. What would he do? The new king first consulted with
                        the older men who had been counselors to Solomon. However, then Rehoboam sought advice from
                        younger men, those of his own age. Following their advice, Rehoboam decided to treat the people
                        harshly. He answered: “I will make your yoke heavier, and I will add to it. My father punished
                        you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.”​—

                    advice. We should also remember the warning example of Rehoboam. When he was faced with a serious
                    decision, he received excellent advice from the older men who had served with his father. However,
                    rather than follow their counsel, he consulted the young men who grew up with him. Following their
                    advice, he made a very bad decision and as a result lost a large part of his kingdom.​—

                        Each of us can examine his heart to see if it is fully devoted to God. Ask yourself, ‘Am I
                        determined to please Jehovah, to defend true worship, and to protect his people from any
                        corrupting influence?’ Think how much courage Asa had to muster to stand up to Maacah, who was
                        “queen mother” in the land! You probably do not know anyone who acts just like her, but there
                        may be a situation in which you can imitate Asa’s zeal. For example, what if a member of your
                        family or a close friend sins, is unrepentant, and has to be disfellowshipped? Would you take
                        decisive action by ceasing to associate with that person? What would your heart move you to do?

                        As a young man, King Asa was humble and courageous. For example, when he succeeded his father,
                        Abijah, he launched a campaign against idolatry. He also “told Judah to search for Jehovah the
                        God of their forefathers and to observe the Law and the commandment.” (

                        ) And when Zerah the Ethiopian invaded Judah with 1,000,000 soldiers, Asa wisely turned to
                        Jehovah for help, saying: “O Jehovah, it does not matter to you whether those you help are many
                        or have no power. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying on you.” This beautiful
                        expression shows how much confidence Asa had in Jehovah’s ability to save him and his people.
                        Asa trusted in his heavenly Father, and “Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians.”​—

                        You would no doubt agree that facing an army of 1,000,000 soldiers was a huge challenge, and it
                        was one that Asa met successfully. Sadly, however, when a less daunting challenge presented
                        itself, Asa did not consult Jehovah. On being threatened by wicked King Baasha of Israel, Asa
                        turned to the king of Syria for help. That decision led to disaster! Through his prophet Hanani,
                        Jehovah told Asa: “Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God,
                        the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.” In fact, from then on, Asa was
                        constantly at war. (

                        Remain humble and continue to rely on Jehovah. When you got baptized, you showed great faith and
                        trust in Jehovah. And Jehovah happily entrusted you with the privilege of becoming a member of
                        his family. The key now is to continue to rely on Jehovah. It may seem that it is easy to rely
                        on Jehovah when you must make life-altering decisions, but what about at other times? How
                        important it is that you trust in Jehovah when making decisions, including those regarding
                        entertainment, secular work, and life goals! Do not rely on your own wisdom. Instead, look for
                        Bible principles that apply to your circumstances, and then act in harmony with that direction.

                                    Never let anyone look down on your youth. Instead, become an example to the faithful
                                    ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.
