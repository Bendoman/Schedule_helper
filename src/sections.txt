Song 106 and Prayer





Jehovah gave Solomon extraordinary wisdom (1Ki 10:1-3; w99 7/1 30 ¶6)
The queen of Sheba was astounded by the wisdom Jehovah gave Solomon (1Ki 10:4, 5; w99 11/1 20 ¶6)
The queen of Sheba praised Jehovah for appointing Solomon as king (1Ki 10:6-9; w99 7/1 30-31)





Like the queen of Sheba, we can show appreciation for God-given wisdom. How? One way is by applying Jesus’ teachings in our life and doing our best to imitate his example. (Mt 12:42; 1Pe 2:21) Another way is to share godly wisdom with others in our ministry.



God’s Word completely equips us to cope with trials in these difficult last days. (2Ti 3:1, 16, 17) Still, we may at times need help to find Bible principles that apply to a specific situation. For example, are you a parent seeking advice on raising children? Are you a teenager coping with challenges to your faith? Are you a widow or widower grieving the death of a mate? You will find material on jw.org that will direct you to specific Bible principles to help you in these and many other situations. —Pr 2:3-6.

Solomon unwisely married women who worshipped false gods (1Ki 11:1, 2; w18.07 18 ¶7)
Solomon’s wives gradually inclined his heart away from Jehovah (1Ki 11:3-6; w19.01 15 ¶6)
Jehovah became furious at Solomon (1Ki 11:9, 10; w18.07 19 ¶9)





God’s Word counsels single Christians to marry “only in the Lord.” (1Co 7:39) Yet, baptism itself does not qualify someone as a suitable mate. Will the person help you to keep serving Jehovah whole-souled? Has the person shown a deep love for Jehovah over time? Before agreeing to marry, take time to get to know your prospective mate well.



Successful Christian marriages honor Jehovah and bring joy to a husband and wife. (Mr 10:9) To have an enduring, happy marriage, Christians must stick closely to Bible principles when choosing a mate.
Pursue a courtship only after you are “past the bloom of youth,” a time when strong sexual feelings can distort your judgment. (1Co 7:36) Make wise use of your years of singleness to strengthen your relationship with God and to develop Christian qualities. Then, you will be in a far better position to contribute to a successful marriage.
Before agreeing to marry someone, take the necessary time to get to know “the secret person of the heart.” (1Pe 3:4) If serious doubts arise, discuss them with your potential mate. As with other human relationships, marriage should be more about what you give than what you get. (Php 2:3, 4) If you apply Bible principles before marriage, you will be laying a fine foundation for a happy married life.

ASK YOURSELF: ‘How can I show that I am content with the necessities of life? How can I show modesty when making decisions?’ —Pr 3:5; 11:2.



Life in the last days is full of challenges. As we near the end of this system of things, difficulties will certainly increase. We may face shortages of one sort or another. (Hab 3:16-18) What will help us to face economic hardship with confidence? We must continue to trust our God, Jehovah. He has promised to care for his servants, and he can provide for us in any circumstance. —Ps 37:18, 19; Heb 13:5, 6.

When a loved one dies, we find comfort in the resurrection hope. Even so, sin and death are like a suffocating shroud that weighs heavily on all of us.
